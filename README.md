Overview 

The idea of this web app is for Elevation Rock Gym to be able create a community of local climbers, and more importantitly to be able to keep track of past climbs they have done. It is important for rock climbers to have a clear history of what they have previously done because it will impact on their performance now. It will show them what they have been consistant with and what needs to be worked on. 

The gym will cycle through new routes every three months so, when a user checks that a route has been completed it will automatically be uploaded to their profile. The only thing that will save is the grade and date of the route. By saving just the grade and date of the route a climber can return to their user page and get a graphical explanation of the routes that they have done.

Currently inprogress - 

Working on a database that when a user is looking at the routes page they can select a checkbox or multiple checkboxs. When those boxes have been checked it will be pulled from the leadRoutes database to the users database.
