Senting.php overview.
The goal is for the user to look at routes that are currently set and be able to tick them when they send them. 
Even though the gym will cycle through routes on a regular basis, by ticking the route, it will store the grade number into the user profile to remember the grade after it has been deleted.
By doing this it will give the climber a good idea of what grades they have done the most of and what and also a time line of their grade. The perpouse of this is for the climber to be able to keep track of their progression of their climbing.
